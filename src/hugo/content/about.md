# About Me

I'm Alex Plagman! I graduated from Eastern Washington University in 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

I'm a firm supporter of open-source code and love to poke around and try new things!

I've been programming (either teaching myself, attending school, or doing side projects) for almost 10 years after discovering [Scratch][Scratch] as a child.

I work with a variety of languages and technologies with a focus on software and desktop application development.

Currently, I'm proudly helping [Chief Architect][CA] develop architectural home design software.

Outside of work, I can probably be found creating mediocre pixel art, messing around with various game frameworks, and frowning every time I see the word "blockchain".
